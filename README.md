# Zoo Keepr
This is a fullstack application that allows the user to view a catalog of a fake zoo and their list of animals and zookeepers. The application allows the user to see a list of animals, narrow their search by either their diet or personality trait. Users can also add to the catalog after filling out the animal's name, species, diet, and personality traits. The user can also add a zookeeper by adding their name, age, and favorite animal. The backend of the application stores all the data and connects with the frontend to allow the user to see what is stored.

## Features
1. The user can add an animal.
2. The user can add a zookeeper.
3. The user can view all animals and zookeepers.
4. The user can narrow their search of an animal by diet or personality trait.
5. The user can narrow their search of a zookeeper by name or age.

## User Story
As a user, I would like a Zoo catalog that I can easily view all the animals and zookeepers. I want the application to have an intuitive search system so that I can narrow my search for both animals and zookeepers. I would also like to be able to add either an animal or a zookeeper.
